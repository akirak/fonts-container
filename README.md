This is a container for downloading font packages from Arch Linux User Repository (AUR) and extracting font files. I am no longer using Arch Linux daily, but AUR has extensive packages, including fonts that are not available in the repositories of other Linux distributions such as Debian.

This repository contains a script for retrieving the files of my preferred fonts using the AUR database.

## TODO

- [ ] Add a Docker build script as well as an installation script to install the fonts to the host machine quickly
